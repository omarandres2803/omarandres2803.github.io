        MONITORING SYSTEM FOR KINETIC ENERGY HARVESTING
      </h2>
      <p>
        In this project the idea was to track a person's heart rate with a
        sensor connected to a microcontroller in the user's wrist. This
        microcontroller would send the data to the user's cell phone through a
        Bluetooth connection and would be stored in a local and remote database
        to be studied as records.
        <br />One of the biggest constraints of this project, was the energy
        consumption. As the device was meant to be a kind of "smartwatch", it's
        battery couldn't be so big. That's why we decided to use a piezoelectric
        material to harvest some energy out of the user's movement, and in this
        way, extend the battery lifecycle.<br />
        In addition to this, we decided to use the Bluetooth Low Energy
        technology, to save even more energy decreasing the electric consumption
        of the microcontroller.
        <br />
        Below I present some images of this project:

        As you can see in the first two pictures, the mobile application gave
        our user the possibility to connect his device to the microcontroller on
        his wrist and also see the data collected in the form of graphics (heart
        rate data and also harvested energy).
        <br />
        The third picture shows the device, which is not so aesthetic, but
        fulfilled the academic interests of the project.
        <br />
        Finally, it is very important to say that I contributed writing a
        scientific article that was selected for the ISCAS conference from the
        IEEE in 2019. If you want more information about the paper, click

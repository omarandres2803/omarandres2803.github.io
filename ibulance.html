			<p>System created to try to solve a common problem in my country, called "the trip of death". This problem occurs when a person suffers an accident and an ambulance picks her up to get him to the hospital but... the hospital can not save her and she dies. <br> Why would the hospital not be able to save this person? Well, if the person is not subscribed to the health promotion companie attended by this hospital, they won't help her. Crazy, right? <br> There is also the possibility that this hospital does not have any more emergency rooms available. So the ambulance would have to go through many different hospitals and as time goes by this person dies. </p>
			
			<p>
				This system uses a database where every citizen of the city should be registered, containing his personal data and the Health Provider Company she is subscribed to. And it uses google maps to calculate the fastest route to a hospital where it is assured that the injured person will be treated.
			
			<br>
				The system consists in a web and mobile application supposed to be used by the ambulance assistant.
